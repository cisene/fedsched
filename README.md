# Federated Schedules
Federated Schedules is an idea that sprung when my wife were talking about her provider of booking system, for which she handles bookings for her pedicare clinic, were complaining that it took them days to respond and that she was paying for nothing as they were slow or didn't respond back.


# Aims with this project
My aims with this project is to provide a simple self-hosted booking calendar service, where anyone could configure and run a calendering server or service, where one or more calendars could be served and be open to booking requests.
